# Thanos.rs (in development)
Implementation of Thanos and his stones in Rust

## What is this, really?
Oh well, you know the [infinity stones](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Infinity_Stones), don't you?
Thanos.rs is a Rust implementation of the infinity stones and [Thanos' snap](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Snap) with relation to files and folders on your beloved PC.

While this is still in implementation, guile and terror looms over he who decides to test it out.

## Features:
- Snap: The ultimate command to delete half the files and folders on the path specified. To be used like so: `thanos snap <dir>`
- Mind: Swaps file and directory names for each other
- Space: Randomly reduces or increases content of files.
- Reality: Moves files and folders to random locations in the filesystem
- Soul: No suitable implementation found yet.
- Power: No suitable implementation found yet.
- Time: No suitable implementation found yet.
